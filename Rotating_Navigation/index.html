            <p> Artificial intelligence (AI) is changing rapidly. 
                The technology, which relies on large datasets and powerful computers, has recently made huge strides in solving real-world problems. 
                As “large language models”—the type of AI that powers ChatGPT, a chatbot made by a startup called OpenAI—have been scaled up, they have surprised even their creators with their unexpected talents.
                Below you will find our most recent coverage, including an explanation of how AI works, and why it matters. For a greater understanding of how AI might change the course of history, read our analyses of its economic impact and of how deep learning will improve scientific research.</p>

            <p> Today “generative ai” models put brush to virtual paper: publicly available apps, such as Midjourney and OpenAI’s dall-e, create images in seconds based on text prompts. The final products often dupe humans.</p>
